# CoVal-SGAN
This script implements the CoVal-SGAN, a complex-valued GAN architecture working with the audio spectrogram for an effective audio data augmentation proposed in:

}

Specifically, the proposed CoVal-SGAN is used to generate new synthetic spectrogram to augment
audio data of the more problematic among the considered class. The augemnted dataset is used
for the classification of different equipments on construction sites.

The complex-valued implementation of the proposed GAN exploits the following software package,
which should be installed:
