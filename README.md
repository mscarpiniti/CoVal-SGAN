# CoVal-SGAN
This script implements the CoVal-SGAN, a complex-valued GAN architecture working with the audio spectrogram for an effective audio data augmentation proposed in [1].

Specifically, the proposed CoVal-SGAN is used to generate new synthetic spectrogram to augment audio data of the more problematic among the considered class. The augemnted dataset is used for the classification of different equipments on construction sites.

The complex-valued implementation of the proposed GAN exploits the following software package [2], which should be installed. See also: https://github.com/NEGU93/cvnn

The implementation of complex batch normmalization is that proposed in [3]. This implementation is available here: https://github.com/ChihebTrabelsi/deep_complex_networks/blob/master/complexnn/bn.py

## Requirements
To use the CoVal-SGAN, the user, in addition to the normal Python modules (tensorflow, librosa, numpy), must install the cvnn library (https://github.com/NEGU93/cvnn) and download the bn.py file (https://github.com/ChihebTrabelsi/deep_complex_networks/blob/master/complexnn/bn.py). Additional details can be found in the 'requirements.txt' file.
